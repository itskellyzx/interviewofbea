<p>Close your eyes and picture an unpainted wooden door... alone and upright by some unnatural force, but so normal-looking, just plain and unassuming, like the front door to your childhood home or a grandparent's house. It's very unlikely, you think to yourself, that this could lead anywhere interesting but a sixth sense persists and so you find yourself reaching out a hand to open the door, drawn towards a curious energy suddenly emanating from the weathered door knob. Instantly, a gentle breeze tickles your nose, and the merry sound of constant chatter is carried to you in friendly whispers from the wind. Encouraged, you step through into a grassy glade surrounded by tall leafy trees, with the comforting smell of pancakes wafting through the air and cute fluffy creatures wandering everywhere for you to greet.

Sitting opposite me with her eyes still tightly closed and nose scrunched up in thought, Bea Kristi (known professionally as Beabadoobee) continues to describe aloud what her imagined world Beatopia looks like: it's very sunny, she can see all her friends, and she feels decidedly at home. Venturing further into Beatopia, Kristi describes to me a little pond in which she can see her reflection: "I look into the pond and I see loads of fish and my reflection; I think I'm tripping and my reflection is really fucked up." Queen of her domain, Bea also explains some other key features of Beatopia: that Beatopians co-opt a giant bee for their public transport system, to beware of naughty fairies that nibble on extruding body parts, and that an entity called The Middle Muncher exists because Beatopians refuse to eat the middle of things (of course!).</p>
        
    <p>For a long time, she thought Beatopia came out of nowhere, but now realises it had a greater significance than it just being a fun activity. In fact, the reason this imaginary land consumed almost every waking hour was because she ultimately preferred it to actual reality. Perhaps, in a way, she <em>needed</em>it. "If I didn't have Beatopia to express my creativity, I would have been just a quiet little kid that was sad all the time."</p>
    <p>Born in the Phillippines, Bea's family moved to the UK when she was three years old in the hope she would receive a better education. She attended an all-girl Catholic school in Hammersmith, west London, where she was one of very few Southeast Asian pupils – an experience she has described as "isolating". She was often bullied, which set in motion a perennial struggle with self-acceptance, and at the age of seven also went to her first therapy session. "There was so much going on in my life," she explains. "It was too much<br/></p>

It was almost an out-of-body experience, I didn't feel like myself at all, and I don't think seven-year-olds should ever have to feel that way as a normal feeling.

It encapsulated the entirety of the record in one song and all the feelings in one song, and it's all about accepting solace and shit times, and appreciating moments like that because it helps you grow as a person. I wrote the song after I tripped on mushrooms for the first time and it was after a long time of going out and getting really fucked up, and I'd beat myself up for it but I think it kind of made me the person I was at the end of writing the record.

That's how my mum taught me a lot of things and I learn a lot from my own experiences in life. So I feel like it's worked out for me, and then if I sing songs about my life and tell stories, I think it makes everything more relatable to everyone.

So it was a sad thing I had to think about, but it was also really empowering, trying to uncover a lot of the feelings I had long repressed - like, very repressed feelings. I just had to face them, write about them, and get over them, and then it made me grow as a person.

Two people have to want to talk to each other. It can't just be a one-sided thing. That's the hardest part.

And that's the good thing about music, is that it's so open to interpretation, that when I write a song and it gets released to the public, it's no longer mine. It's everyone's now, and then you kinda listen to it in a different light - like, it can mean so many other things and I can listen to it from an outside perspective. Writing music really helps me understand that. I totally get the fucking victim complex... i.e.

After the pandemic, I've just kind of been in this weird daze, and at some points, I think it's moving fast, but now that I'm back on tour it feels like it's moving really slowly again. I think it's just because I'm really excited for Christmas. Christmas in London is super magical. And I've just got a place of my own, I've got a boyfriend, and I can't wait to get a cat and have a Christmas tree and eat loads of food and sit by the fire. I just love Christmas.
